# Prediction of Soil–Water Characteristic Curve (SWCC)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`explo.ipynb`) demonstrating a machine-learning pipeline to predict the Soil–Water Characteristic Curve (SWCC) using soil properties. SWCC relates volumetric water content with matric suction and plays a key role in geotechnical and hydrological engineering.

## 📘 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Train and evaluate ML models to predict volumetric water content at various matric suction levels using soil physicochemical features.
- **Notebook**: `explo.ipynb` — includes data loading, exploratory analysis, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
